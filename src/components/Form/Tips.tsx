// In JavaScript, the spread operator (...) is used to spread the elements of an iterable (like an array or object) into another array or object. When used in JSX, the spread operator can spread the properties of an object onto an element.

// Consider a basic example with a JavaScript object:

const inputProps = {
  type: "text",
  placeholder: "Enter your name",
  autoFocus: true
};

// JSX with spread operator
<input {...inputProps} />
// In this example, inputProps is an object containing properties for an HTML input element. By using the spread operator (...inputProps), we spread all the properties of inputProps onto the <input> element in JSX. This is equivalent to writing:


<input
  type={inputProps.type}
  placeholder={inputProps.placeholder}
  autoFocus={inputProps.autoFocus}
/>

// So, the spread operator simplifies the process of assigning multiple properties to an element by spreading them from an object.
